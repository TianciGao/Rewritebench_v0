# PORT_0013

`PORT_0013` is a canonical public-release PORT case package for portability and cross-engine adaptation review. It is packaged for correctness, portability-boundary evidence, hard-negative checking, and plan/failure observability.

## Case Summary

MySQL-oriented source computes the female-client percentage for high-a11 districts using boolean aggregation syntax. The positive PostgreSQL adaptation preserves female counting with an explicit CASE expression and dialect type syntax. The package records dialect and engine portability risk using retained static evidence; it does not create new cross-engine execution results.

## Case Design

- Source SQL: `sql/source.sql`.
- Positive rewrite/adaptation: `sql/positives/pos_01.sql`.
- Hard negative: `sql/negatives/neg_01.sql`.

The hard negative changes the counted gender literal from F to M and changes the aggregate filter semantics. The expected rejection reason is `gender_filter_literal_changed` and is static-inferred from SQL plus retained result evidence. The approval status is recorded in `checker/expected_rejections.yaml`.

## Portability Boundary

No DB rerun was performed during migration. No new cross-engine execution result, transfer-speed claim, complete nine-case PORT closure claim, ranking claim, or leaderboard claim was created. Any cross-engine interpretation must come only from retained evidence and the paper protocol.

## Public Release Boundary

No evidence was regenerated. Denominator unchanged. Paper results unchanged. Common-core membership unchanged. No global leaderboard is established. Raw legacy evidence was not modified.

## Evidence Map

Retained evidence is indexed in `evidence/runs_retention.yaml`. Hard-negative expectation metadata is in `checker/expected_rejections.yaml`. Raw legacy runs are mapped and retained as do-not-delete originals; they were not copied wholesale.

## Validation Script Caveat

The copied validation scripts are retained legacy validation assets. They are not final public user runners. Future public runners should write outputs outside case-local `runs/` by default.
