# SQL-RewriteBench Migration Run Log

Purpose:
This file records each Codex execution round in chronological order.
It is an execution ledger, not a decision log and not a status snapshot.

Rules:
- Append one section after every Codex task.
- Record only what was actually done.
- Always state whether the legacy repo was modified.
- Always state whether denominator, paper results, case membership, or raw evidence changed.
- Link to commit hash and important raw URLs when available.
- Do not store secrets, prompts, API keys, or private logs here.

- Full case migration: no.

Validation:
- `python -m py_compile scripts/dev/validate_case_package.py` passed.
- `python scripts/dev/validate_case_package.py --mode evidence-pilot ...` passed for all six cases.

- Inspected legacy `cases/PERF/PERF_0006` read-only.
- Created a canonical-layout migration plan for a performance-sensitive analytical PERF case.
- Created source-to-target mapping, proposed canonical tree, manifest preview, runs-retention preview, performance evidence boundary preview, validator expectation matrix, public hygiene precheck, risk register, abort conditions, future actual migration prompt, and planning summary JSON.
- No actual case migration was performed.
- No `cases/PERF/PERF_0006/` release package files were created or modified.

Validation:
- `python -m py_compile scripts/dev/validate_case_package.py` passed.
- Planning summary JSON parsed.
- Manifest preview and runs-retention preview YAML parsed when PyYAML was available.
- `git diff --check` passed.

Paper/denominator impact:
- denominator changed: no
- paper results changed: no
- case membership changed: no
- raw legacy evidence changed: no
- actual case migration performed: no

Next safe action:
- Human review of the `PERF_0006` canonical-layout plan, then decide whether to execute the future actual migration prompt. Do not start Common-core 40 migration.
